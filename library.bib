abstract = {Pulse shaped voltages are required for preservation of food with PEF. Several pulse forms generated by a variety of circuits are compared with respect to required energy. The analysis includes square pulses, trapezoidal pulses, exponential decay pulses and oscillatory and over-damped oscillatory pulses. The base of comparison is the establishment of a certain minimum voltage level during certain minimum time. The comparison concerns the dissipation in a resistive load, which is considered to be representative for a category of loads, including PEF. Furthermore, the ratio between initial capacitor voltage and corresponding threshold voltage is compared as this parameter reflects the required hold voltage of the switch in the circuit. The analysis shows that the efficiency approaches 100{\%} for hard switched circuits and circuits with transmission lines. For highly damped RLC-circuits with capacitor C, inductor L and load resistance R the maximum obtainable efficiency is between 37 and 47{\%} where the capacitor C has to be charged to 1.6-1.8 times the desired threshold voltage. For oscillating damped sinusoids the maximum efficiency is between 47 and 52{\%}, however, the capacitor has to be charged to 1.8-3 times the threshold voltage. Graphs with an example are provided to determine circuit parameters from a certain pulse specification. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pulsed electric field (PEF) processing is a novel mild treatment for pumpable foods preservation at low or moderate temperatures. The electric field strength and the temperature distribution in the treatment chamber have been identified as the key processing parameters affecting the treatment efficacy and possibly the sensorial and nutritional quality of the food. A full 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a pilot-scale PEF system with co-linear configuration of the electrodes was developed. The model couples the fluid dynamics and the electrical field and can be used to predict the liquid's flow pattern, electric field distribution, temperature increase, and residence time in the treatment chamber. A total of 48 process conditions with different settings of applied voltage V, pulse length ??, pulse repetition rate (frequency) f and flow rate V?? in combination with four different inlet temperatures were simulated for a model liquid food (NaCl solutions with two different electrical conductivities) and whole milk. The simulated PEF energy dissipated into the liquids was between 4 and 66 kJ/kg and process temperatures ranged from approximately 25 to 80 ??C. The predicted temperature data agree well (R2 > 0.99) with experimental measurements in five locations of the treatment chamber using fibre optic probes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Toepfl2007,
abstract = {Preservation of liquid foods by high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) is an interesting alternative to traditional techniques like thermal pasteurization. Based on the underlying mechanism of action, in this paper the crucial process parameters electrical field strength, total pulse energy input and treatment temperature were investigated experimentally. Inactivation studies were performed with three bacteria (E. coli, Bacillus megaterium, Listeria innocua) and one yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Stainless steel and carbon electrodes have been tested to investigate their applicability as electrode material. Simulating the influence of cell size and orientation as well as the presence of agglomerations or insulating particles indicated that the applied field strength has to be increased above the critical one to achieve product safety. It was found that temperatures higher than 40 ??C can strongly increase the lethality of the PEF process. In this way also small cells like Listeria are easily affected by pulsed fields even at a field strength as low as 16 kV cm-1. In addition, heating of the product prior to PEF has the advantage that most of the required process energy can be recovered using heat exchangers. Exemplary, such a process is analyzed by an enthalpy balance. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The inactivation kinetics of pectin methyl esterase (PME) during the shelf life (4 °C-180 days) of freshly squeezed orange juice samples processed by both pulsed electric fields (PEF) and heat pasteurization (HP) was evaluated in the study. The PME inactivation level after the PEF (25.26 kV/cm-1206.2 $\mu$s) and HP (90°C-20 s) treatments were 93.8{\%} and 95.2{\%}, respectively. The PME activity of PEF-processed samples decreased or did not change, while that of HP samples increased during storage (p < 0.01). A kinetic model was developed expressing PME inactivation as a function of the PEF treatment conditions, and this enabled the estimation of the reaction rate constant (587.8-2375.4 s -1), and the time required for a 90{\%} reduction (De, 3917.7-969.5 s). Quantification of the increase in PEF energy to ensure a ten-fold reduction in De (ze, 63.7 J), activation electric fields (-921.2 kV cm-1mol-1), and electrical activation energy (12.9 kJ mol-1) was also carried out. Consequently, PEF processing was very effective for the inactivation of PME and for providing stability of orange juice during storage. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Overall quality of apple juice is an important factor to consider in processing, since some attributes, such as aroma, colour and flavour, are well appreciated by the final consumer, and are associated with freshness and authenticity. Non-thermal processing was tested in apple juice pasteurization in order to verify its feasibility in microbial inactivation, as well as its possibility of rendering a product impaired in terms of some sensory attributes. The non-thermal technique of high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEF) treatment, was compared with conventional high temperature-short time (HTST) pasteurization. Effects of process variables, such as voltage intensity and frequency for the PEF treatment, as well as temperature and time for the HTST pasteurization were investigated over inactivation of Escherichia coli and changes of pH and colour. Both techniques achieved more than five log reductions in microbial inactivation, normally considered the standard for fruit juices pasteurization. Apparently, PEF preserved better the pH than HTST as the thermal treatment showed an increase in this physicochemical property. Some variability was observed in terms of colour for all the treatments.},

abstract = {Nowadays Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatment of food needs to be performed prior to packaging, either hygienic or aseptic packaging is necessary. New techniques for PEF treatment after packaging can be considered when plastic conductive (film) electrodes can be integrated within the package, so that the package and the product can be treated as a whole. This paper describes a newly developed treatment chamber, which can be used to test the ability of any arbitrary plastic packaging film to be used as electrodes for PEF treatment. Tests with a flexible commercially available electrically conductive copolymer film showed that reduction of Lactobacillus plantarum by PEF was possible. This heat sealable film obeys the mechanical properties of a polymer; however it has an electrical conductivity of 0.75 S m- 1 and approximately 2.3{\%} of the surface area is electrically conductive. The maximum obtained inactivation was 2.1 log10 with a specific energy of 17 J ml- 1. The microbial experiments gave a consistent outcome compared with finite element simulations and with models from literature. Further research to reach real pasteurisation levels is needed as well as issues concerning utilisation of these film electrodes. Industrial relevance: Stainless steel electrodes, which are widely used as electrode material for Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) treatment systems, have as main disadvantage that they exhibit certain wear. This article showed that polymer composites can be considered as electrode material for newly to be developed PEF treatment concepts. With extensive research on food grade composite films the integration of cheap disposable plastic electrodes in food packages comes within reach. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mild heat pasteurization, high pressure processing (HP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) processing of freshly squeezed orange juice were comparatively evaluated examining their impact on microbial load and quality parameters immediately after processing and during two months of storage. Microbial counts for treated juices were reduced beyond detectable levels immediately after processing and up to 2 months of refrigerated storage. Quality parameters such as pH, dry matter content and brix were not significantly different when comparing juices immediately after treatment and were, for all treatments, constant during storage time. Quality parameters related to pectinmethylesterase (PME) inactivation, like cloud stability and viscosity, were dependent on the specific treatments that were applied. Mild heat pasteurization was found to result in the most stable orange juice. Results for HP are nearly comparable to PEF except on cloud degradation, where a lower degradation rate was found for HP. For PEF, residual enzyme activity was clearly responsible for changes in viscosity and cloud stability during storage. Industrial relevance: Development of mild processing technologies with a minimal impact on fruit juice can be considered as a true alternative of fresh fruit. The present work presents a fair comparison of mild heat treated, high pressure (HP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) processed orange juice as an alternative for thermal pasteurization.

abstract = {During the last decades pulsed electric field (PEF) processing received considerable attention due to its potential to enhance food products or create alternatives to conventional methods in food processing. It is generally acknowledged that PEF processing can deliver safe and chill-stable fruit juices with fresh-like sensory and nutritional properties. Relatively low-processing temperature and short residence times can achieve highly effective inactivation of microorganisms while retaining product quality. A first commercial application of PEF for preservation of fruit juices was launched in 2006 in the United States. Since then, industrial-scale processing equipment for liquid and solid products were developed and, in Europe in 2009, an industrial juice preservation line was installed using 20 kV/cm pulses at 40 to 50 °C to extend the chill-stability of fruit juices, including citrus juices and smoothies, from 6 to 21 d. The related PEF processing costs are in the range of US 0.02 to 0.03 per liter and are justified due to access to new markets and reduced return of spoiled product. However, despite its commercial success there are still many unknown factors associated with PEF processing of fruit and citrus juices and many conflicting reports in the literature.

abstract = {This reference text shows how and why RF energy is created within a printed circuit board, and the manner in which propagation occurs. With thorough explanations, this book enables engineers to grasp both the fundamentals of EMC theory and signal integrity, along with the mitigation process needed to prevent an EMC event while maintaining optimal functionality for low- and high-technology products. Mr. Montrose also shows the relationship between time and frequency domains, helping one meet mandatory compliance requirements.},
